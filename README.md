# particleThings
Turn things into particles and play around
## About
particleThings is a group project made by Kalvin Janik, Zeana Llamas, and John Noonan. Together we set out to make a "particle system" that allows the user to play around with a mesh. The project is interacted with the mouse and controlled by the parameter GUI. Choose from several models and sprite representations of the particles and drag, repel, and attract to your hearts desire.
## Implementation
particleThings is made using three.js, stats.js, dat.gui.js, and mouse-speed.js. Implementation of the project is found in pt.js.
